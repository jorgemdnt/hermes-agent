"""Draw instruction marks on the user's screen from the Hermes desktop GUI.

``annotate_preview`` marks the page inside the in-app browser; this is its
sibling for the rest of the screen. HUD mode floats Hermes over whatever the
user is actually working in — a chess app, a DAW, a spreadsheet — and "which
move should I make?" wants an answer drawn on the board, not a paragraph of
square names. The desktop's Electron main process owns a transparent,
click-through, always-on-top overlay window and paints the shapes; this module
is just schema + a thin dispatcher over the platform-injected callback.

Coordinates ride the agent's own eyes: the model passes the pixel size of the
screenshot it analyzed (``frame_width``/``frame_height``) and every shape's
coordinates in that same pixel space. Electron resolves the target window's
current bounds and maps frame pixels onto screen points, so Retina/DPI scaling
never leaks into the schema.

Round-trips through the gateway's blocking-prompt bridge like ``tour``:
tui_gateway emits ``screen.annotate.request``, the desktop renderer asks its
main process (which owns the overlay window) and answers
``screen.annotate.respond`` with the outcome.

Lives in the ``desktop_ui`` toolset, which the GUI gateway enables only for
desktop-sourced sessions.
